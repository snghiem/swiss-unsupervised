# Unsupervised learning classification on Swiss provinces

In this repository, I use principle component analysis (PCA) and clustering methods.

Note that PCA looks for a low-dimensional representation of the observations
that explains a good fraction of the variance while clustering finds 
homogeneous subgroups among the observations.
